# Homework 1

## Problem 1

The penguins dataset has already been installed and loaded, named
penguins.

``` r
summary(penguins)
```

    ##       species          island    bill_length_mm  bill_depth_mm

    ##  Median :197.0     Median :4050   NA's  : 11   Median :2008

    ##  NA's   :2         NA's   :2

The penguins dataset has 344 rows and 8, consisting of data on penguins
like species, island, body measurements, sex, and year. The mean flipper
length is 200.9152047.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=flipper_length_mm, color=species)) + 
  geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_jt3466_files/figure-gfm/scatterplot-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("scatterplot.pdf")
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

This is a scatterplot of flipper length in mm against bill length in mm,
with colors corresponding to the species of penguin. There are 2
observations with NA for bill and flipper lengths, so the warning that
these observations were removed have been suppressed in this code chunk.

## Problem 2

``` r
test_df <- tibble(
  rsamp=rnorm(10),
  vec_logical=rsamp>0,
  vec_char=c("This", "vector", "is", "a", "character", "vector", "with", "a", "length", "10"),
  vec_factor=factor(c("easy","medium","hard","medium","medium","easy","hard","hard","easy","medium"))
)

mean(test_df$rsamp) # [1] -0.0877404
```

    ## [1] 0.2978376

``` r
mean(test_df$vec_logical) # [1] 0.5
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(test_df$vec_char) # [1] NA Warning message: argument is not numeric or logical, returning NA
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(test_df$vec_char): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(test_df$vec_factor) # [1] NA Warning message: argument is not numeric or logical, returning NA
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(test_df$vec_factor): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Taking the means of the random sample and the logical vector works.The
random sample is of all numeric values, and the mean of the logical
vector works because TRUE is numerically 1 and FALSE is numerically 0,
so being a random normally distributed samples, these average out to
0.5.

However, the means of the character and factor vectors do not work, as
these cannot be internally be coerced to numeric.

``` r
test_df |>
  mutate(
    rsamp=as.numeric(rsamp),
    vec_logical=as.numeric(vec_logical),
    vec_char=as.numeric(vec_char),
    vec_factor=as.numeric(vec_factor)
  )
```

    ## Warning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.
    ## ℹ In argument: `vec_char = as.numeric(vec_char)`.
    ## Caused by warning:
    ## ! NAs introduced by coercion

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##      rsamp vec_logical vec_char vec_factor
    ##      <dbl>       <dbl>    <dbl>      <dbl>
    ##  1  0.600            1       NA          1
    ##  2  0.570            1       NA          3
    ##  3  0.0389           1       NA          2
    ##  4 -0.393            0       NA          3
    ##  5  1.32             1       NA          3
    ##  6 -0.268            0       NA          1
    ##  7  0.968            1       NA          2
    ##  8  0.785            1       NA          2
    ##  9 -0.139            0       NA          1
    ## 10 -0.505            0       10          3

The output retains the random sampling values, coerces the boolean
values to corresponding 1s and 0s, and cannot coerce character or factor
values to numeric. NAs are introduced instead, showing why the means
cannot be calculated for these variables that cannot be coerced to
numeric variable type.
